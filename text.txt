Troy's README.md Generator

This app takes command line input and automatically generates, formats and writes the README.md file to disk, customized with what the user entered.  **In fact, the README.md you're reading right now was generated with this very program!  Wow!  How Meta!**  The user is asked to enter a multitude of points of data regarding the respository, and places them in their respective sections of the README.  When the user picks the project's license, a badge is generated at the top of the file as well.


Assuming you've got node installed, simply type: node index.js


Answer each prompt honestly, and use the arrow keys to select your license.
